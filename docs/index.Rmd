# Summary
The use of this report is to inform those of the correlation between political leaning and containment and neutralization of the COVID-19 virus. Since its discovery in late 2019, COVID-19 has been a growing issue and evaluating the success of efforts to contain it is an important issue. To identify similarities between politics and neutralization efforts multiple points of data will be evaluated. The data being: election results, vaccine, hesitancy, death counts, and mask use. To begin, the election held in 2020 contained vital information for the political leanings of the public. The votes are as such: Donald Trump had `print(num_votes_trump)` votes, whereas Joe Biden had `print(num_votes_biden)` votes. This states that majority of the US population was leaning towards democrat and higher restrictions on protection against COVID-19. From this, the average percentage of people who actually wore masks can be correlated to political leaning. `print(never_mask_avg)` percent of people did not choose to wear a mask outdoors, `print(sometimes_mask_avg)` percent of people sometimes chose to wear a mask, and `print(always_mask_avg)` percent of people always chose to wear a mask. From this data it can be deduced that 51% of the population chose to wear a mask outdoors correlating to the data that democrats were majority of that population at the time. In contrast, those who chose to not wear masks as often fell ill quicker and easier. The number of deaths from January 1, 2020 to October 22, 2022 was `print(avg_covid_deaths)`. An idea can be construed that death counts can be correlated to mask usage further proven by political leaning and policies made between 2020 and 2022. Further evidence is needed to prove this and will be produced in visual displays.

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
